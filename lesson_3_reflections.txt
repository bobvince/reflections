When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if you are working away from your local area or If you want people to collaborate with you on the project
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
some items you work on may be exp ones and items you are not yet ready to share
